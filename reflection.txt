Portfolio Website Project Documentation

Topic Selection
I chose to create  my first full blown website a personal portfolio website with feevol. know me.
because I wanted to showcase my journey as a UI/UX Designer, 
Project Manager, and aspiring Full Stack Developer. 
This project allowed me to present my skills, engagements, 
and creative work in a cohesive digital space while 
demonstrating my technical abilities.

Work Distribution
Since I worked individually on this project, 
I managed all aspects of development. I structured 
my workflow by first creating the design mockups in 
Figma, then building the HTML structure for all pages 
(home, engagements, and creatives), followed by implementing 
the CSS styling, and finally adding interactive elements 
and animations to enhance user experience.

Biggest Challenge
The single biggest challenge I faced was translating 
my Figma design into proper CSS code. The visual design 
looked perfect in Figma, but implementing the exact spacing, 
colors, animations, and responsive layouts in CSS proved 
difficult. I solved this by breaking down each section 
methodically, using CSS Grid and Flexbox for layouts, 
carefully measuring spacing values, and iteratively testing 
hover animations until they matched my vision. This process 
taught me the importance of design-to-code translation skills 
and attention to detail.
